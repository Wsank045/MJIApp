# MJIApp

This app is built using react native. This app was initially created for a non-profit organisation to help them to manage their members, specially their young members.

Cette application doit permettre à l'application de mieux gérer l'intégration des nouveaux arrivants dans l'organisation. Each "onboarding agent" is assigned a list of people to follow and they must update the information of the people being followed and report daily in the application.
Among the integration agents there are some who are administrators and it is they who can add or remove other agents

Here is a preview of some images of the application
